Minor translator of python objects into `asymptote` files.
Basically, what I need are 3D .pdf files, and `asymptote` actually can
accomplish this in a reasonable manner.

There are a couple of other packages that attempt to interface python
with `asymptote`, but I don't think they do what I need.
They're at https://github.com/memmett/PyAsy, and
http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/graphics/asymptote/base/asymptote.py.
